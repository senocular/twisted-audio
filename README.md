## More information

This was a school project where I believe the assignment was something to the effect of: create a web page that is interactive. I don't recall the actual details of the assignment. And really, at that point in time I the assignment served more as a source of inspiration for me than rules to be followed - and the professors were happy to let me get away with it.

A big component of the project was the command prompt. Most of the inputs were crowdsourced, hence the profanity. I was a little surprised by my classmates with that one. Frustration was common and conversation quickly spiraled into insults and cursing. There are some not so nice words in there, but I'm going to be keeping them in for the purposes of historic preservation.

In fact everything should be exactly as it was 20+ years ago. Surprisingly, it still seems to work with modern browsers, even with all the popups (though window size may be a little off in some cases).

Spoiler: If you want easy access to all the different parts of the project without schlepping through everything (it was designed in many ways to be annoying and/or confusing), you can use the command "debug" (no quotes) in the initial command prompt.
